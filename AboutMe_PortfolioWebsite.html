<h2>
    Hi there, my name is Dhriti Shah, and I am an 18 year old Sophomore Communication Design Student and a brand strategist in the making.
And, I can create things, well some- times. 
I am someone who likes to discover and experiment, with, well anything. I would keep quite in my room and just ponder upon life, moreover, the people around me are quite important to me, and hence, I am always scrutinising and studying them. I like to be as detached and reasonable as possible. 
A lot of my work reflects upon my observation and my ravenous dreaming ability. <br>
I strongly believe that design has the ability to iron out any problem, which is why it is of utmost importance. I often venture to establishing constraints for myself and like all, well I procrastinate. <br> 

Thank you for visiting my page. </h2>
